If you are reading this post, welcome! 

They say never start with an apology, but I shall break that. I will start by appologising that youh ave stumbled upon 
this content. It is not well presented, or polished, or even that interesting to a far amount of you I imagine. But, I shall explain why

I am fortunate enough to work in a role that a lot of variance. I get to work with some wonderful people on some very mixed projects. I increasingly find that I always seem to have a need for something I built weeks, months or years previously, only to not be able to find it and have to start all over again. Hence this page. 

This is for me to be able to easily recall the pieces I need, and thought I woudl make it all public, in case it helps anyone else

Enjoy!
