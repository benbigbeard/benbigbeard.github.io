I"‚<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Ben.
I like to build things, break things (on purpose or otherwise), and understand how they work. This site is where I share the projects Iâ€™m working on, what Iâ€™ve learned along the way, and a few thoughts that donâ€™t always fit neatly into a slide deck. If youâ€™re into hands-on problem solving, creative tech, or just figuring stuff out as you go â€” welcome.</p>
