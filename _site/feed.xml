<p>They say never start with an apology, but I shall break that. I will start by appologising that youh ave stumbled upon 
this content. It is not well presented, or polished, or even that interesting to a far amount of you I imagine. But, I shall explain why</p>

<p>I am fortunate enough to work in a role that a lot of variance. I get to work with some wonderful people on some very mixed projects. I increasingly find that I always seem to have a need for something I built weeks, months or years previously, only to not be able to find it and have to start all over again. Hence this page.</p>

<p>This is for me to be able to easily recall the pieces I need, and thought I woudl make it all public, in case it helps anyone else</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>]]></content><author><name>Ben Lovley</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have found a growing need/want to keep a record of the varied things I get to work on...]]></summary></entry></feed>
