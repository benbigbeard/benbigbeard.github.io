Hi, I’m Ben.
I like to build things, break things (on purpose or otherwise), and understand how they work. This site is where I share the projects I’m working on, what I’ve learned along the way, and a few thoughts that don’t always fit neatly into a slide deck. If you're into hands-on problem solving, creative tech, or just figuring stuff out as you go — welcome.
