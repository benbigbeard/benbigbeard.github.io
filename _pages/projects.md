Here’s a selection of the things I’ve built or contributed to:

- **Splunk Interactive Demo App** — A live iOS app that streams telemetry to Splunk for demoing observability.
- **RC Vehicle ESP32 Mod** — Replacing the ECM of a Traxxas TRX-4M with an ESP32 and controlling it via web UI.
- **Fysher Vice** — A novelty 3D-printed adult toy line styled like Fisher-Price.

More to come soon...
